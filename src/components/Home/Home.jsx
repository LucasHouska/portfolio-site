          Hey there! And welcome to my portfolio site! I'm a Ruby, Java, and
          JavaScript developer who specializes in modernizing complex systems,
          architecting scalable solutions, and keeping applications secure and
          efficient. From upgrading frameworks to developing microservices, I
          ensure that legacy code evolves without disrupting functionality. Iâ€™ve
          led large-scale security initiatives, optimized cloud infrastructure,
          and worked with teams across the globe to solve challenging technical
          problems. I'm currently working to make this site beautiful, but take
          a look around and see what I've been working on!
